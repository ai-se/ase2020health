### Revision detials:

  A. Clarification about health indicators, health is too big to say, hard to define, what we did is to explore indicators

  B. An explanation on why we use these indicators

  C. Mapping from features to health justification

  D. Description of DECART model construction

  E. Explain we need to know the trend (how do we know to what extent a number indicates a project healthy)

  F. Features correlation justification



### Reviewer 1:

  1. “I could not see an explicit link of how the selected 7 health indicators will help those users.” (B, C)

  2. “the paper does not provide an intuition why these 7 metrics predicted in this work can be good health indicators.” (A, B)

  3. “The authors did not discuss the gap or limitation of those prior works.” (NA, we did in sec2)

  4. “I don’t think the authors can argue that their work has better results than other works if the authors did not conduct an experiment to compare the performance.” (NA)

  5. “Why CART + DE? Why DE? Why this statistical analysis?” (NA)

  6. “It is very unclear to me how the authors build the prediction models.” (D)

  7. “Why the MRE and SA of the 1-month prediction is 100%? Shouldn’t MRE close to zero?” (NA)


### Reviewer 2:

  1. “The projects health indicators defined in the paper are not novel, which are commonly used in the existing literature.” (A)

  2. “What means project health exactly? Or, how do we know those features can indicate project health?” (B, C)

  3. “Notice that the features in the existing literature are not extensively included, why?” (B)

  4. “How do we know to what extent a number indicates a project healthy?” (B, E)

  5. “The 12 features (listed in Table 4) may greatly correlate with each other.” (F)

  6. “RQ2 explores "What features matter the most in prediction". However, there is no explanation of why this question matters.” (NA)

  7. “Their data was not available to other researchers is wrong” (NA)

  8. “The project health indicators are confusing, inconsistent.” (NA)

  9. “What means 78,455 months of data from 1,628 Github projects? Is it cumulative by the number of months per project?” (NA)



### Reviewer 3:

  1. “From the predicted values, how can we judge whether the projects are healthy or not?” (B, C)

  2. “What is the definition of 'not suitable' and 'irrelevant' repositories in this study?” (NA)

  3. “There are projects whose monthly commits are 0. With such inactive projects, is your data appropriate?” (E)

  4. “Why these 7? Is this set enough? What are the relations with these indicators and project health?” (B, C)

  5. “I think it inappropriate to show the results as the percentages compared with one-month results” (NA)

  6. “One missing threat to validity is the existence of confounding factors.” (NA)
